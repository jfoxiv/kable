# kable 

Kable is my senior project written for my "IT - Application Development" bachelor's degree from Oregon Institute of Technology. The basic idea was to create a web application that could be used by student computer lab administrators. See the "FINAL DOC" file for specifics.

I'd do it differently now, but when I wrote this, I'd only taken the introductory C# course, so I don't hate it. My only real disappointment is that I was never able to add user accounts.
